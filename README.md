## **Activity 1:** Design Your Own Class! 🏗️

a) Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).
<br>
b) Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!
<br>
c) Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
<br>
d) Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.

## **Activity 2:** Polymorphism Challenge! 🎭

Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (like move()). However, make each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving" 🚗, while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ✈️).
